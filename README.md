# Blazor-CarInventoryDataGrid
Utilizing Radzen and Blazor to build a basic CRUD application representing the management of an inventory of cars at a dealership.

This was built using the principles of clean architecture as it applies to the onion architecture, top-down dependency management, and modular monolith applications.

Blazor applications built in this fashion are good candidates for reusable libraries, developing in team settings, and increasing testability and reusability of code.
